The Teleport Command
====================

The *Teleport* command is an improved version of the Unix/Linux `cd` command. 
It can be used on all Unix/Linux systems, including Mac OS X.


Features
--------

The teleport command (`tp`, for short) does everything the Linux `cd` command does, 
with these improvements:

* It keeps a history, remembering the directories you've visited before.
* It can display your history.
* It lets you easily jump (teleport) to any directory in your history.
* You can create aliases for your directories to make it even easier to jump to them.

You can see a short video demo of Teleport in action at this URL:

Bash Command-Line Completion
----------------------------

The Teleport command can also use Bash command-line completion. That is, when you type
a partial directory name, your Teleport history will be searched and if a directory is
found that matches the partial directory name you have typed, that directory name will be
automatically completed for you. See the *INSTALL.md* file for more information on this
feature.
