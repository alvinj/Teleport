This file contains installation instructions for the Teleport command,
Version 0.6.

Introduction
------------

As mentioned on [the Teleport page](http://alvinalexander.com/linux/linux-teleport-command-cd-improved),
the teleport command (`tp`) is an improved version of the traditional
Unix/Linux/GNU `cd` command. A simple way to think about it is that its
the `cd` command, with a memory.

The only way I know of to get the Teleport command to work (without rewriting 
the `cd` command) is to write it as a Bash function. 

Therefore, the way to make the Teleport command available to you is to invoke 
it from one of your Linux startup files, either *~/.bashrc*, or *~/.bash_profile*.


Installation
------------

Installation is very simple, and requires just a few steps, as shown here:

1) Copy the *tp_command* file to your HOME directory. Personally, I rename
   my file to *.tp_command*, and that's what I'll use for this documentation,
   but you can name this file whatever you like.

2) Move to your home directory, and issue the following two commands:

```
touch .tp_aliases
touch .tp_history
```

3) Edit your *~/.bash_profile* or *~/.bashrc* file, and add a line similar to
   this:

```
. .tp_command
```

   This command tells Bash to "source" the *.tp_command* file, so make sure you
   use whatever filename you used in Step 1.

   If you're not familiar with the dot command, "sourcing" a file like this
   reads all the Bash code in that file into the memory of your Bash environment, 
   and makes the `tp` and `tpa` commands available to you.

4) If you're new to Linux, just log out and then log back in again, and the 
   `tp` and `tpa` commands should be available to you.

   Or, if you're comfortable with Linux/Unix, you have probably surmised that 
   you can just run this command without having to log out and then log back 
   in again:

```
. .tp_command
```

   Either approach should work fine.

5) Now, just start using the `tp` command to move between directories instead of 
   the `cd` command.  I hope you'll like it as much as I do.


Enabling Teleport Completion
----------------------------

Thanks to a nice addition by [SneakyBobito](https://github.com/SneakyBobito), 
you can use Bash completion with Teleport. When you type a command like this:

```
tp Twit
```

and then hit the `[Tab]` key, this new code will scan your Teleport history file, and if
it finds any matches, it will automatically complete the directory. For instance, I have
a directory named *TwitterClient* in my *.tp_history* file, so when I type this:

```
tp Twit[Tab]
```

my command is expanded to this:

```
tp TwitterClient
```

This code is completely optional for you, but it's a great feature. To install this feature
you need to know a little bit about how Bash completion works. For instance, I just got it
running on a Mac OS X system by installing the bash-completion module for OS X with Homebrew.
I first used this command to install the bash-completion module:

```
brew install bash-completion
```

Then I modified my .bash_profile file as the instructions indicated. Next, I copied the new
*completion* file to the Homebrew bash-completion directory like this:

```
cp completion /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/teleport
```

After that, I started a new OS X Terminal session and used the new Bash completion code with
the `tp` command, and it worked like a charm.

Note that your bash-completion directory may be different depending on your operating system
and how you installed bash-completion. For example, the correct directory on SneakyBobito's
system is this:

```
cp completion /etc/bash_completion.d/teleport
```

So again, you need to know something about Bash completion to get this to work, but once you
get it working it's a terrific addition to Teleport. (So many thanks to SneakyBobito for this
contribution.)


Teleport Help
-------------

You can get basic help on the Teleport command like this:

```
tp -h
```

You can also get basic help on the Teleport Aliases command like this:

```
tpa -h
```

To Uninstall Teleport
---------------------

If you want to un-install Teleport for any reason, just reverse the steps 
shown above. Specifically, follow these steps:

1. Remove the ~/.tp_command file.
2. Remove the ~/.tp_aliases file.
3. Remove the ~/.tp_history file.
4. Remove the line you added to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file.
5. Remove the option bash-completion script and any bash-completion code you added to your
   ~/.bash_profile file.
