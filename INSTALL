This file contains installation instructions for the Teleport command,
Version 0.5.

INTRODUCTION
------------

As mentioned on the "teleport" page (http://alvinalexander.com/linux/linux-teleport-command-cd-improved),
the teleport command ("tp") is an improved version of the traditional
Unix/Linux/GNU cd command. A simple way to think about it is that its
the cd command, with a memory.

The only way I know of to get the Teleport command to work (without rewriting 
the cd command) is to write it as a Bash function. 

Therefore, the way to make the Teleport command available to you is to invoke 
it from one of your Linux startup files, either ~/.bashrc, or ~/.bash_profile.


INSTALLATION
------------

Installation is very simple, and requires just a few steps, as shown here:

1) Copy the tp_command file to your HOME directory. Personally, I rename
   my file to .tp_command, and that's what I'll use for this documentation,
   but you can name this file whatever you like.

2) Move to your home directory, and issue the following two commands:

   touch .tp_aliases
   touch .tp_history

3) Edit your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file, and add a line similar to
   this:

   . .tp_command

   This command tells Bash to "source" the .tp_command file, so make sure you
   use whatever filename you used in Step 1.

   If you're not familiar with the dot command, "sourcing" a file like this
   reads all the Bash code in that file into the memory of your Bash environment, 
   and makes the "tp" and "tpa" commands available to you.

4) If you're new to Linux, just log out and then log back in again, and the 
   tp and tpa commands should be available to you.

   Or, if you're comfortable with Linux/Unix, you have probably surmised that 
   you can just run this command without having to log out and then log back 
   in again:

   . .tp_command

   Either approach should work fine.

5) Now, just start using the tp command to move between directories instead of 
   the cd command.  I hope you'll like it as much as I do.

ENABLE TELEPORT COMPLETION
--------------------------

Defaultly the completion will be the same as cd. You can add the handy teleport completion. 

Just copy the completion file to the bashcompletion list

``cp completion /etc/bash_completion.d/teleport``


TELEPORT HELP
-------------

You can get basic help on the Teleport command like this:

tp -h

You can also get basic help on the Teleport Aliases command like this:

tpa -h

TO UN-INSTALL TELEPORT
----------------------

If you want to un-install Teleport for any reason, just reverse the steps 
shown above. Specifically, follow these steps:

1) Remove the ~/.tp_command file.
2) Remove the ~/.tp_aliases file.
3) Remove the ~/.tp_history file.
4) Remove the line you added to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file.
